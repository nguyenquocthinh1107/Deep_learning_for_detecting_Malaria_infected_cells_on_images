# Deep learning for medical image (Case study: disease malaria)

## Architecture Used:-
  #### YOLOv4, SSD Resnet50, UNET, computer vision, html, Flask api

## How to run (on local):-

### 1. Make an conda enviornment with python 3.7 or upper versions.

### 2. To run it locally make sure other than requirements.txt you have to install "opencv-python" and "opencv-contrib-python" libraries. As we are adding docker base image as opencv we are not adding them on the requirements.txt folder. 

### To install those libraries command  

        pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python
        
### 3. To install rest of the packages use command 

         pip install -r requirements.txt
         
### 4. Run "app.py" .
